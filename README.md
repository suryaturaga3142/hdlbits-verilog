# hdlbits-verilog

If you've seen my repository for [chipdev HDL questions](https://github.com/suryaturaga3142/chipdev-verilog), you'll know that I liked them quite a bit. That said, I thought it would be good to solve some hdlbits as well, simply because it's a more mainstream website for practicing hdl problems. Here's the link for reference.

### https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Problem_sets

I'm doing this after starting chipdev practice. Honestly, some questions in hdlbits aren't really _that_ challenging. You might not see them in this repo. I prefer working just the interesting problems :)

### Note about the content

Like I mentioned before, I didn't make the questions. So I'll stick to the modules, but you might see a comment every now and then suggesting a better coding style that would make life easier. For example, replacing ```[DATA_WIDTH-1:0] dout0```, ```[DATA_WIDTH-1:0] dout1```,... with ```[DATA_WIDTH-1:0] dout [n-1:0]```.
